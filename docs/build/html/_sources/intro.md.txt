The New Horizons Mission, the first to travel to the Pluto system, was launched
in 2006 and flew past Pluto on 14 July 2015. After the successful completion of
its primary mission, an extended mission was granted to investigate the Kuiper
Belt Object (KOB) 2014 MU69 (Arrokoth). The New Horizons mission data were
originally developed and archived in PDS3 format. This dictionary was developed
as part of the PDS4 migration effort, and includes all phases of the primary and
extended mission.
