Alphabetical List of Classes
**************************************************

A complete list of all classes in the New Horizons Mission Dictionary, in alphabetical
order, is available through the `PDS4 Data Dictionary <https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/documents/dd/current/PDS4_PDS_DD_1L00/webhelp/all/>`_
page, which is regenerated automatically with each release of the PDS4 Information Model.

To find the New Horizons Mission class list, look down the list of (alphabetically sorted) 
dictionary prefixes in the left menu for "Classes in the nh namespace".
Select that item and the list of classes will be presented on both the left and 
the right as clickable links.

Clicking on the specific class name will produce a grid with the full, formal
definition of the class.

Clicking on the class name in the "Referenced from:" line at the bottom of the
grid will take you to the containing class, where you can see the cardinality
of the class (i.e., whether it is required, optional, or repeatable) in the
containing class.

You can also click on the attribute names listed to see details of the 
attribute definitions.
