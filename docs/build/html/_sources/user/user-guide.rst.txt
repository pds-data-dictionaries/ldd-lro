Introduction
##################################################

This *User's Guide* provides a brief overview of the 
New Horizons Mission (NH or "nh:") namespace for those working with data from
New Horizons primary or extended missions. The primary New Horizons mission 
was to the Pluto system. The extended missions to date have been called
the "Kuiper Belt Extended Missions 1 and 2", or "KEM1" and "KEM2", in the
mission documentation and metadata.

----

   **Note** *that the New Horizons legacy data migration is in its early stages, with* 
   *labels being designed for each instrument in turn. This namespace is in active* 
   *development and will continue to be so for the forseeable future.* 

----

Data from the primary and first extended ("KEM1")
missions were archived in PDS3 format and migration is underway to convert the 
legacy data into PDS4. These migrated products will also serve as templates for the
second extended ("KEM2") mission, which will be delivered in PDS4 format.

This guide presents the major features of the namespace.

Organization of Classes and Attributes
##################################################

The New Horizons dictionary has a single top-level class that must be used to
access any of the NH metadata classes. Below that, there are major subclasses
for metadata that is common to all (or multiple instruments), as well as
classes specific to particular instruments. Processed and calibrated data will
generally have additional classes to provide instrument-specific processing
details.

The following sections describe the major divisions of the New Horizons Mission
namespace, in the order in which they occur in the schema (and thus, labels).

**************************************************
Top-Level Class: <nh:Mission_Parameters>
**************************************************

The *<nh:Mission_Parameters>* class acts as a wrapper for all other NH classes.
It contains one required attribute and (as of this writing) two optional classes
for data specific to the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) part of
in the Ralph instrument package.

The class contains a single required attribute, *<nh:mission_phase_name>*, with the
string identifying the mission phase. Mission phase names are unique to the
primary or extended mission in which they occur. Specifically, the phases in the
extended missions contain the extended mission acronym ("KEM1 Encounter", for 
example).

The major subclasses of the *<nh:Mission_Parameters>* class are:

- :ref:`<nh:Observation_Parameters><observation-parameters>`
- :ref:`<nh:MVIC_Calibration_Information><mvic-calibration-information>`
- :ref:`<nh:Radiometric_Converstion_Constants><radiometric-conversion-constants>`

You can see a complete outline of the namespace under the
:doc:`../detailed/outline` topic.

.. _observation-parameters:

**************************************************
Subclass: <nh:Observation_Parameters>
**************************************************

The *<nh:Observation_Parameters>* class provides details specific to the New 
Horizons mission and the instrument used to make the observation comprising the
data product. It provides three attributes and two classes. As in the PDS
common namespace, in the NH dictionary attributes names are all lowercase; 
class names are in title case.

This class contains:

- <nh:telemetry_appid>
- <nh:sequence_id>
- <nh:observation_description>
- <nh:Mission_Elapsed_Time>
- <nh:Detector>
- <nh:LORRI_Target_Information>
- <nh:Spacecraft_State>

None of these components is repeatable; all are expected to be present in all raw
and processed/calibrated data labels.

<nh:telemetry_appid>, <nh:sequence_id>, and <nh:observation_description>
  These attributes are provided primarily for provenance and to provide some minimal
  description of planned activities for the end user. The *nh:telementry_appid* is
  tied to instrument operating mode and to onboard processing like data compression. 
  The mission documentation for each instrument will provide further detail 
  if desired. The *<nh:sequence_id>* ties into the instrument observing plan, and
  the codes comprising that ID are roughly translated into something approaching
  English in the *<nh:observation_description>* string.

<nh:Mission_Elapsed_Time>
  The *<nh:Mission_Elapsed_Time>* class provides the spacecraft clock partition and
  count at the start and end of the observation comprising the data product.
  The translation from spacecraft clock to UTC is dependent on the hardware and is
  usually described in the mission documentation. Many missions and end-users use
  the publicly available Navigation and Ancillary Information (NAIF) Toolkit to 
  perform this conversion.
  
<nh:Detector>
  The *<nh:Detector>* class identifies the detector used to make the observation,
  and includes classes to provide detector-specific parameters. "Detector" may
  mean an instrument, or it may mean literally one of several detectors available
  within an instrument (as is the case of the MVIC instrument, for example). This
  class will contain detector-specific subclasses where needed to provide specific
  observational settings for the detector.
  
<nh:LORRI_Target_Information>
  The *<nh:LORRI_Target_Information>* class provides attributes specific to the 
  targeting of a LORRI imager observation.
  
<nh:Spacecraft_State>
  The *<nh:Spacecraft_State>* class provides information about thruster firings,
  spin state, scan rate, and spacecraft motion at the time of the observation.
  
  
.. _mvic-calibration-information:
  
************************************************
Subclass: <nh:MVIC_Calibration_Information>
************************************************
  
The *<nh:MVIC_Calibration_Information>* class is used in labels for processed
data from all seven MVIC detectors. It provides detector-specific quantities
used in processing the data, and in the case of the MVIC framing camers, it
provides the specific left- and right-side biases used to process each frame.
  
This class contains:
  
- <nh:physical_pixel_size>
- <nh:read_noise>
- <nh:gain>
- <nh:tdi_median_bias_level>
- <nh:Framing_Biases>
  
<nh:physical_pixel_size>, <nh:read_noise> and <nh:gain>
  The *<nh:physical_pixel_size>* value is constant for all pixels on all MVIC
  detectors. It is provided explicitly for the convenience of users 
  further analyzing to the data. The *<nh:read_noise>* and *<nh:gain>* are 
  also provided for all MVIC observations.
    
<nh:tdi_median_bias_level>
  The *<nh:tdi_median_bias_level>* appears only in processed time delay integration
  (TDI) observations, from the color channels and the two panchromatic TDI channels.
  Bias levels for the TDI channels are determined during cruise operations and 
  may be updated through the course of the mission.
    
<nh:Framing_Biases>
  The *<nh:Framing_Biases>* class only appears in processing sequences from the MVIC
  framing array. It contains one *<nh:Frame_Bias_Levels>* class for each frame
  comprising the observation that identifies the frame by number and lists the 
  left- and right-side bias levels applied
  in processing that particular frame. For framing observations, bias is measured 
  during each observations using shielded pixels on either edge of the array.
   
.. _radiometric-conversion-constants:
 
*************************************************
Subclass: <nh:Radiometric_Conversion_Constants>
*************************************************

**NOTE:** *As of version 1.1.0, this class replaces the deprecated
<nh:MVIC_Conversion_Constants> class. The content of that class is included in this
one, with additional constants added as needed. This class is used by multiple instruments.*

The *<nh:Radiometric_Conversion_Constants>* class is used in labels for processed
data from all seven MVIC detectors. The MVIC pipeline does not produce "calibrated"
data in the sense that PDS defines "calibrated" - specifically, "Data reduced to 
physical units". The final reduction step depends on both the spectal characteristics
of the target and whether that target is resolved. Instead, the calibration 
documentation provided with the archive includes formulae for applying the absolute 
calibration for specific targets, and the constants needed to plug into the
formulae are provided in this class.

This class contains:

- <nh:pivot_wavelength>
- <nh:Resolved_Source>
- <nh:Unresolved_Source>

<nh:pivot_wavelength>
  The *<nh:pivot_wavelength>* attribute contains the pivot wavelength of the
  filter/dectector combination. 
  
<nh:Resolved_Source>
  The *<nh:Resolved_Source>* class provides the units of measure (units of radiance, 
  in the case of resolved targets) applicable to the resulting pixel values.
  Other attributes contain the conversion constants for five targets:
  
    - The Sun
    - Jupiter
    - \(5145\) Pholus, a centaur
    - Pluto
    - Charon
    - Arrokoth

<nh:Unresolved_Source>
  The *<nh:Unresolved_Source>* class provides the units of measure (units of 
  irradiance, in the case of unresolved targets) applicable to the resulting pixel
  values. Other attributes contain the conversion constants for five targets:
  
    - The Sun
    - Jupiter
    - \(5145\) Pholus, a centaur
    - Pluto
    - Charon
    - Arrokoth
