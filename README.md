# About This Repository
* **[build](build)/** - This directory holds the files generated by the
  build processing, including the schema files used in designing and
  validating labels, JSON for inclusion in code, and report files from the
  LDDTool execution that created the files. There are separate
  subdirectories for development versions and releases.
* **[doc](docs)/** - This directory contains the source tree for the 
  documentation at https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/ldd-lro. The
  PDF of that documentation can also be found here in the `main` branch/
* **[logs](logs)/** - This directory contains the logs generated by the
  GitHub-automated build and test processes of LDDTool and Validate.
* **[src](src)/** - The directory containing the managed *IngestLDD* file
  that defines this namespace. This is where changes to the namespace
  itself are made.
* **[test](test)/** - This directory contains regression tests (in the
  form of documented labels) for this namespace.
* **[.github](.github)/** - This (possibly hidden) directory contains
  internal files used to manage the automated build processes.
The `main` branch is where you should merge your final changes to documentation and LDD structure.
The `gh-pages` branch is auto-generated and used to run the documentation site. **DO NOT MAKE CHANGES HERE**.

<!-- replace "repo id" below with the "ldd-xxx" string from the
GitHub repo URL.-->
There is a common place to request enhancements and report problems for
any PDS-curated dictionary - the [PDS4 Issue Repo](https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/issues/new/choose).
Search for the \[ldd-lro\] update request block and click the green "Get Started" button.

## Contribute Code or documentation
If you'd like to actively contribute to development, begin with the
feature/bug process described above. Then familiarize yourself with
the [LDD Update Process](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-update.html).

# General Support for Dictionary Developers
See the [PDS Data Dictionaries pages](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io)
for documentation and tutorials describing the procedures
required to reserve a namespace,
establish a new repo, and build your dictionary.

If you need help creating your *IngestLDD* file, contact the [Dictionary Stewards Group](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/teams/pds-dd-stewards.html). Documentation is in preparation.
# For Dictionary Stewards
See the [tutorial on updating and building an IngestLDD](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/support/tutorials.html#ldd-update-and-build-tutorial) and the [LDD Update Process](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-update.html) for documentation of those procedures.
## Building the dictionary
Each build is auto-generated using Github Actions, PDS4 LDDTool, and Validate Tool.
You can also download the *IngestLDD* file and build the dictionary locally.
You will need to install *[LDDTool]* (https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/index.html) on your system. Once you do,
you can manually run [LDDTool](https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/index.html) on the IngestLDD using the following command:

```
lddtool -lpsnJ {IngestLDD file name}.xml
```

## Versions (Source)

[PDS4_LRO_IngestLDD.xml](src/PDS4_LRO_IngestLDD.xml)

## Builds

A Local Data Dictionary (LDD) is built for each version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/).
The build process insures compatibility of the LDD with the core information model.

This LDD has been built for the following versions of the PDS4 information model.

[1.19.0.0](build/release/1.19.0.0)
[1.20.0.0](build/release/1.20.0.0)
[1.21.0.0](build/release/1.21.0.0)

## Notes

Each build is generating using the [lddtool](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/software/ldd/) specific to a version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/). The build command used is:

```
lddtool -lp ldd-file.xml
```
